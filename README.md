# JavaScript Fundamentals – Variables & Console Output

This repository contains small JavaScript practice exercises focused on
core language fundamentals.

## 📌 What this exercise covers

- Declaring variables using `let` and `const`
- Understanding variable reassignment
- String concatenation with variables
- Program execution order (top to bottom)
- Using `console.log()` for debugging and output

## 📂 Example file

**`variables-and-console/bot.js`**

This file simulates a simple conversational flow using variables that
change over time and are reflected in logged output.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this exercise is not to build an application, but to build
a strong foundation in JavaScript fundamentals that are essential for:

- Debugging
- Writing predictable code
- Preparing for technical interviews
- Learning more advanced concepts like functions and DOM manipulation

## 🚀 Next steps

Future exercises in this repository will expand into:
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Arrays and objects
- DOM interaction
